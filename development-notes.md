# Development notes

First of all please note these notes describe my process of getting the whole project working including the physical side of things
like actually building the adapter and dumpster diving for some additional parts. For more patch-notey information see readme

## Motivation and origins of the project

The project began after I had found IBM Model M with finnish layout.

As a keyboard enthusiast the need to get it working as my
daily driver immediately hit me and soon after this I also realized the PS2-to-USB adapters I already owned would not be fit
for the purpose. The reason here being that these adapters were "dumb" as they only connected wire to wire and didn't translate
between the old and new protocols.

After briefly checking the prices and delivery times for smart adapters I soon decided that this would be excellent learning
opportunity. The journey began with the very helpfull guidance of Buutti OY's robotics club. The initial plan was to piece together
various libraries and use them on Arduino Pro Micro but this proved to be nearly impossible as all libraries meant to parse PS2
protocol produced some mystical errors I still can't decipher to this day.
