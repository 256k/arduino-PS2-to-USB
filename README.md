# Arduino PS2-to-USB
This project allows you to use Arduino as USB adapter for PS2 keyboards like IBM model M

## Installation and usage
To use Arduino as adapter you should first connect PS/2 keyboard cables wires to arduino

    V+    to  VCC
    GND   to  GND
    Data  to  pin2
    Clock to  pin3
    
Then connect arduinos USB to PC with any suitable cable and upload the code as a normal scetch to arduino

* First release confirmed to be working with Windows7 and Windows10. Most likely works on most operating systems with some degree of accuracy with keymaps

* Requires arduino with USB host cababilities. Confirmed working on Arduino Pro Micro

* Currently only supports Finnish keymap with 104 keys or less. If you want to help adding more keymaps feel free to email me 

* Pausebreak key toggles numpad numbers to work as mouse (0 and 5 for mousebuttons)

## Todo and coming up changes
- [ ] Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] Add support for capslock etc. lights
- [ ] Add support for more keys
- [ ] Add support for en-us keymap
- [ ] Add easy-to-configure remapping system
- [ ] Convert code from scetch to library form
- [ ] Better mouse emulation support
